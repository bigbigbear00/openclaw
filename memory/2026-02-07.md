- **Goal**: Backfill historical Telegram chat data into the memory system database (RAG).
- **Input**: User provided three Telegram HTML export files (`messages.html`, `messages2.html`, `messages3.html`), which I located in `~/Downloads/Telegram Desktop/ChatExport_2026-02-07 (3)/`.
- **Action**: Attempted to run the backfill script `memory_system/scripts/backfill_telegram_html.py`.
- **Troubleshooting**:
    1. Resolved a missing `bs4` dependency by creating a Python virtual environment (`memory_system/.venv`) and installing requirements.
    2. Resolved a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `memory_system` by running the script as a module from the project root (`/Users/apple/clawd`).
- **Outcome**: The final backfill execution **FAILED**.
- **Root Cause**: The script terminated with an `openai.RateLimitError` (HTTP 429), indicating `insufficient_quota`. The OpenAI account has run out of funds or hit its usage limit.
- **Status**: The memory backfill task is **blocked** until the user resolves the OpenAI billing issue. I informed the user of the failure and the required action.
- **System Health**: A routine heartbeat check (`job_monitor.py check`) confirmed no cron jobs were missed.
