PM2 cleanup performed: 2026-02-10T14:21:00+08:00

Actions taken:
- Backed up /Users/apple/.pm2/dump.pm2, dump.pm2.bak, pm2.log into /Users/apple/clawd/reports/backups/pm2_cleanup_20260210.tgz
- Moved copies to /Users/apple/clawd/reports/backups/ (dump.pm2.20260210.bak, dump.pm2.bak.20260210, pm2.log.20260210)
- Removed original dump.pm2, dump.pm2.bak, pm2.log from /Users/apple/.pm2 to clean registrations and stopped process records.

Audit:
- Backup archive: /Users/apple/clawd/reports/backups/pm2_cleanup_20260210.tgz
- Individual backup files: /Users/apple/clawd/reports/backups/dump.pm2.20260210.bak, /Users/apple/clawd/reports/backups/dump.pm2.bak.20260210, /Users/apple/clawd/reports/backups/pm2.log.20260210

Note: Remaining /Users/apple/.pm2/logs and pids left intact for future inspection. No running pm2 processes detected at time of cleanup. If you want me to purge logs or reset pm2 configuration further, authorize next steps.
