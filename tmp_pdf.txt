A Proposal by CityCloud Technology
for the Development of Smart Karachi
As Pakistan’s largest city and economic hub, Karachi has long faced challenges in
social security and public services, which negatively impact sustainable urban
development. To systematically address these challenges, Karachi urgently needs to
advance its smart city development. CityCloud Technology, a leading Chinese expert
in city-level big data intelligence, aligns with China’s national digital strategy and has
actively contributed to the planning, construction, and operation of smart cities across
China for many years. With extensive experience, CityCloud Technology is among the
first enterprises in China to deeply and comprehensively participate in smart city
projects. Based on this expertise, CityCloud Technology proposes the following
recommendations for the Smart Karachi initiative.
I. Development Objectives
Leveraging big data and intelligent technologies as the core, the project aims to build a
citywide, interconnected security network. By integrating multi-source data fusion, AIpowered analysis, and fully digitalized event-handling processes, it will enable social
risk early warning and closed-loop online incident resolution, thereby strengthening
social safety. Simultaneously, it will drive the digitalization and intelligence of public
services to improve quality and enhance citizens’ satisfaction.
II. Development Plan
Smart Karachi's development draws on China's advanced expertise in smart city
initiatives, implementing a 5A layered architecture framework:
Amalgamation Layer (A1): Establishes digital infrastructure.
Accumulation Layer (A2): Supports data resource development and
operations.

Acceleration Layer (A3): Accelerates workflows with AI capabilities.
Activation Layer (A4): Provides foundational support for application systems.
Application Layer (A5): Covers safety and smart city applications.
Full-cycle technical operational services will also be provided to ensure alignment with
project goals. The specific development components are outlined below.
1. Amalgamation Layer
•

Command Center: Includes a command hall (for citywide monitoring and
dispatch), exhibition hall (to showcase achievements), conference hall (for
remote collaboration), office areas, and dedicated equipment rooms.

•

Perception and Patrol Equipment: Deploys video surveillance, traffic
checkpoints, drones, robotic dogs, and IoT devices (e.g., for municipal,
environmental, and law enforcement monitoring).

•

Communication Network: Upgrades Karachi’s existing network with a
dedicated video transmission network (switches, fiber optics, etc.).

•

Computing Centers: Builds CPU-based general computing centers and GPUpowered AI computing centers.

•

Cloud Platform: Develops a city-level cloud platform covering computing,
storage, networking, and security.

2. Accumulation Layer
•

Integrated Data Resource Platform: Offers data governance, visualization
modeling, intelligent search, and warehousing tools to transform raw data into
assets.

•

Data Development and Operation Service: Ensures continuous data
classification, storage, updates, and maintenance for efficient utilization.

3. Acceleration Layer
•

Large Model Platform: Provides multi-scenario AI models and services.

•

Small Model Platform: Delivers specialized models for specific tasks, either
standalone or combined with large models.

•

Intelligent Agent Platform: Integrates models to develop, debug, and deploy
AI agents for complex problem-solving.

4. Activation Layer
•

Unified Authentication Platform: Enables single sign-on across systems.

•

Unified Video Management Platform: Manages live streams, recordings, and
metadata.

•

Unified IoT Management Platform: Centralizes control of heterogeneous IoT
devices.

•

Unified GIS Platform: Integrates geospatial data with video and IoT for
emergency command.

5. Application Layer
•

Safe City:
o

Safe City System: Citywide event detection and response.

o

Drone/Robotic Dog Systems: Patrol management and landing zones.

o

o
•

Digital Twin City: Real-time monitoring and digital twin integration.

Smart City:
o

Smart Customs: Enhances trade efficiency and risk control.

o

Smart Parking: Unified city parking management.

o

One-Stop Government Services: Streamlines public service delivery.

o

Low-Altitude Logistics: Facilitates cross-regional delivery services.

6. Technical Operational Service
The development of smart cities is characterized by the involvement of multiple
departments, extensive use of advanced technologies, diverse application scenarios, and
numerous sub-projects. To ensure alignment between outcomes and objectives,
professional technical oversight and adjustments are required throughout the process.
Key services include integrated planning and coordination of projects, consultation and
planning for sub-projects, and comprehensive technical review of solutions.
III. Expected Outcomes
The Smart Karachi initiative will prioritize "Technology Empowering Security and
Data-Intelligence Driving Services" as its core principle. Through technology
integration and institutional innovation, it aims to achieve comprehensive
improvements in social security and public service levels, laying a solid foundation for
sustainable urban development. By unlocking the value of data resources, Smart
Karachi will redefine urban governance and service paradigms, positioning itself as a
pivotal hub on the Digital Silk Road while providing a replicable "Karachi Model" for
digital transformation across South Asia.
